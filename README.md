## Description

_A simple two-player dice game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1._

## Rules of the Game
_Each player rolls a die until they either roll a 1 or decide to "hold". The first player to score at least 100 points wins._
* _If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn._
* _If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues._
* _If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn._

## Test

  * _Describe: diceRoll()
    Test: It will return a random whole number between 1 - 6
    Code: diceRoll()
    Expected Output: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6

  * _Describe: Player()
    Test: It will create Player {}
    Code: Player()
    Expected Output: {turnTotal: 0, scoreTotal: 0}

    Test: It will use diceRoll() roll and add it to turnTotal
    Code: player.roll(5)
    Expected Output: {turnTotal: 5, scoreTotal: 0}

    Test: It will take turnTotal and add it to scoreTotal and put turnTotal to 0
    Code: player.hold()
    Expected Output: {turnTotal:0, scoreTotal: 5}

    Test: It will make turnTotal to 0 if it receives 1
    Code: player.roll(1)
    Expected Output: {turnTotal: 0, scoreTotal: 5}    

  * _Describe: winCheck(playerOne, PlayerTwo) 
    Test: It will determine whether either player has turnTotal + scoreTotal: >= 100
    Code: winCheck(playerOne, playerTwo)
    Expected Output: playerOne, playerTwo, or false
